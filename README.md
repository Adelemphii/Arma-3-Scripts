# Arma-3-Scripts

## Current Scripts: 
* fill_water_bottle_script.sqf
   * A simple script which is applied to objects. When applied, 1 action is added which will fill all half empty/fully empty bottles of water/canteens in the player's inventory.
* water_source_script.sqf
   * A more complex version of the fill script, doing most of the same things but has a limited SOURCE within the object. This script introduces 2 more actions, the ability to check the remaining source (1:1 for bottles/canteens) and the ability to refill the source by emptying bottles/canteens in a player's inventory.

## How to use: LOCAL SCRIPTS
1. Open script sqf file
    * The water_bottles scripts are LOCAL scripts which are applied to objects
2.  Copy the script of choice, and paste it into the INIT function of the object.
3.  Success.
